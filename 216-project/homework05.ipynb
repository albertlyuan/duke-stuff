    "### Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A website is trying to increase registration for first-time visitors, exposing a random subset of these visitors to a new site design. Of 752 randomly sampled visitors over a month who saw the new design, 64 registered. Construct a 95% confidence interval for the percentage of visitors who would register for the website under the new design using the normal distribution. Save your answer in a tuple `q1_1` with 2 `numpy.float64` items that `q1_1[0]` is the left bound and `q1_1[1]` is the right bound. Use percentages for both bounds, for example, save 50.0 in your answer for 50% of visitors.\n",
    "2. A study examined the average pay for a random sample of men and women entering the workforce as doctors for 21 different positions. If each gender was equally paid, then we would expect about half of those positions to have men paid more than women and women would be paid more than men in the other half of positions. In the study, men were, on average, paid more in 17 of the 21 positions. Complete a hypothesis test using the normal distribution (two-sided or one-sided, just be clear which you are reporting) to examine whether there is significant evidence (at the 0.05 level) of gender discrimination in pay in these positions. Report your p-value and interpret the result. Save your p-value in `q1_2` as a `numpy.float64` and interpret it in the \"Answer 1\" cell."

    "### Question 4\n",
    "The `Star Wars (1977)` film is quite popular, with a median rating of 5 out of 5. However, male users gave it a slightly higher average rating of about 4.4 whereas female users gave the same movie an average rating of about 4.2.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Consider the null hypothesis that the average rating of `Star Wars (1977)` is the same for `sex='F'` and `sex='M'` users. The alternative hypothesis is that the average ratings are not equal. Conduct a two-sided t test using [`stats.ttest_ind`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.ttest_ind.html) to evaluate this using the sample ratings data. Report your p-value and interpret it at a significance level of 0.05. Save your p-value in `q4_1` as a `numpy.float64` and interpret it in the \"Answer 4\" cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. About 51% of female users rated `Star Wars (1977)` a `5` (the highest rating). Consider the null hypothesis that 51% of male users rate `Star Wars (1977)` a `5`. Conduct a two-sided hypothesis test  using [`stats.t.cdf`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.t.html) to evaluate this in light of the sample ratings data of male users who rated `Star Wars (1977)`. Report your p-value and interpret it at a significance level of 0.05. Save your p-value in `q4_2` as a `numpy.float64` and interpret it in the \"Answer 4\" cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Consider the null hypothesis that female and male users are equally likely to rate `Star Wars (1977)` a `5`. Conduct a two-sided t test using [`stats.ttest_ind_from_stats`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.ttest_ind_from_stats.html) to evaluate this in light of the sample data of female and male users who rated `Star Wars (1977)`. Report your p-value and interpret it at a significance level of 0.05. Save your p-value in `q4_3` as a `numpy.float64` and interpret it in the \"Answer 4\" cell. You should observe a different p-value than in step 2 despite the hypotheses under consideration being ostensibly similar. Briefly explain why you observe this difference."
