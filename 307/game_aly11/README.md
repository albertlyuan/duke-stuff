### Notes/Assumptions


### Impressions
Given that I joined this class on Friday, I was a little fearful about being able to complete this project.
However, now that I've done it I am more that pleased with what I've done in such time. I still have a lot to learn 
about javafx and about clean code, but I think I did a good job extracting a method from the square generation loops and
creating effective classes. I definitely believe that this isn't a perfect game: the bouncing is a little buggy, and I didn't have enough time to
figure out how to make an end screen (like a "you win" or a "you lose").
