### Testing Strategies and Importance of Testing
Strategies
* use testfx to click buttons
* use assert to test expected vs actual values
* create tests after creating methods to stay on top of things
Importance
* Make sure changes in code don't cause bugs in old code
* Make sure edge cases work to ensure method works correctly

### Model Tests
* each of commands
* test out of bounds
* handling bad inputs

### View Tests
* comparing the existance and state of drawing and turtle to expected
* ensure that buttons and UI have the correct text
* make files are loaded and read
* ensure that reseting works
* ensure instruction execution works correctly
