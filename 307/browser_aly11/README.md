### Tutorial and other Resources Used


### Resource Attributions


### Running the Program

Main class: main.java

Data files needed: 

Key/Mouse inputs: Typing for inputting urls and favorited names. Clicking to interact
with the site, button to go back/forward and setting home.

Known Bugs: Since the testers aren't running a scene, there will be exceptions raised when the the
program tries to make an alert for invalid urls.


### Notes/Assumptions


### Impressions
This was a little more difficult than the others for me because of two main factors. One,
this project introduces a lot of new javafx concepts like URLs that I haven't played around with
before. Second, I was very fatigued this weekend so I was unable to spend as much time as I wanted to.
