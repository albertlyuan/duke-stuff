### Contributions and Roles

* Describe your role(s) and your satisfaction
  * I worked on backend and more specifically on the model. I created all the algorithms 
  for determining how the grid changed. I think overall, I've done a satisfactory job. I've been 
  to all of our meetings, I've contributed ideas to our design discussion, and I've fulfilled team 
  design requirements such as using lambdas, using interfaces, etc. Also, all the models have been 
  functional, which should be some indication that I'm doing things right.

* Describe your team mate(s) role(s) and their satisfaction
  * Aaric and Nick worked front end. I can't really differentiate exactly which parts they did individually,
  but they've done a great job. The UI look very clean, and they've both contributed very significant
  thoughts to our design. I know Nick did the whole view grid, which uses affines to allow us to basically use any
  cell shape (that is if we can figure out the math). I know Aaric created a lot of
  buttons and sliders that allow the user to edit simulation conditions and save current simulation configurations.
  Overall, both were great, they've contributed many hours and it shows.
  * Dane worked backend with me. He worked primarily on file parsing and everything config related,
  the grid and cell classes, and more recently he's been making the histogram view. He's done a great job and 
  working with him has been really easy because he communicates very effectively. 


### Team Events

* Describe when you felt the most satisfaction
  * The night before the basic version was the first time we met to combine everything we had. Seeing
  a view (that I never touched) work with each of the 5 models was really cool to see. 

* Describe when you felt the team made the biggest leap ahead
  * The night before basic was when the team made the biggest leap. Before we just had a bunch of pieces
  that didn't connect, and by the end of the night, it was a complete puzzle. 

* Describe way(s) the team has worked well
  * We communicate very effectively, and we are all very willing to spend hours in one sitting to crank
  out a lot of the project. I think this group has by far been the most productive and knowledgeable 
  group that I've ever been a part of at Duke. I've never had to worry about if a teammate could do something
  and I've never had to worry about the code not being well-designed.

* Describe problem(s) with the way the team worked together
  * Sometimes we had people idle because their part was simpler or needed someone else's part to 
  be completed first. Perhaps we could've planned small tasks for them to do in the meanwhile. 


### Learning Opportunities

* Your biggest strength as a team member
  * I think I'm very willing to spend a lot of time and I produce code that works. 
  I communicate effectively, and I also do my fair share of the work.

* Your biggest weakness as a team member
  * I will often forget to test before committing or leave certain hard coded values (from testing) 
  which screws things up when merges happen. I also prioritize getting functionality over clean code 
  which means I spend a considerable amount of time refactoring afterwards.

* What you have learned team collaboration/communication during this project
  * This was the first time that I was on a team that split backend/frontend. I definitely think this
  was the way to go. It makes it a lot easier to manage workloads and it results in code that is more
  encapsulated since you are aware that your teammates will have little idea about how your code works 
  on the inside.

* A specific thing can you do to make team collaboration/communication more productive
  * I can reduce the amount of rushed commits that I do so we spend less time debugging issues. I think 
  also I can work on making my commits more frequent so that they are easier to keep track of.
