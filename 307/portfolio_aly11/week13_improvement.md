## Habits

* Some to keep
  * There are a lot of habits that I plan to keep. Mostly I plan to keep on making my code clean and
  encapsulating functionalities. 

* Some not worth keeping
  * I think this class helped me develop a very big reliance on intellij, which although is a powerful 
  tool, isn't what every company/class is going to be using. I really enjoy intellij's tools for 
  refactoring (gosh it would be a pain to change a single variable name).

* Some to explore later
  * I don't think I've grasped the concepts of all the design patterns, and I think this might be useful
  in the future.

* Value of checklists?
  * I think these checklists are valuable resources for keeping my code writing disciplined. I think 
  I probably will revisit these checklists in the future to make sure my code is well designed.


## Programming Skills

* Delightful code
  * I think the cellsociety project was really a delightful project overall. I think this was a result of my team
  being on the same page, which couldn't be said for the other teams. In particular, it was really cool to see
  when one of our frontend people created the triangle shape view. I just really enjoyed how everything
  we did, although separate, all worked together and fit in pretty seamlessly.

* Lessons from worst coding experience
  * I found that communication is very important. My ooga group wasn't very good at communicating 
  what changes they planned on/already did, so we often had a ton of refactoring work and merge
  conflicts. 

* Lessons from best coding experience
  * I learned tha testing is a really nice thing to have. By creating tests, you understand how your
  code should work, and you create something that allows you to easily see if changes to your code
  ruined past functionalities.

* Interesting skills beyond coding
  * Like I said before, I never really realized the power of intellij, especially the refactoring tools.
  I'm not sure if my reliance on it is a good thing, but I really enjoyed using it. A skill I
  learned that I had, was contributing ideas during discussion. I really enjoy just pouring out 
  any ideas (good or bad) and talking with teammates about the validity of them.


## Personal

* Personal strengths
  * I thought I knew how to be a pretty good teammate coming into this project. I'm a captain for the
  ultimate frisbee team, so I understand how frustrating it is when people don't contribute what they
  should be contributing effort-wise. I think this course reinforced that, since all of my peer reviews
  were mostly positive when it came to whether or not I did my fair share of the work.

* Personal weaknesses
  * I'm not that good at communicating. I like to just do things and then talk later. However, I've
  realized how detrimental this is, and I think I've gotten a lot better at this, since I found that
  I actually like communicating a lot more.

* Habits to stop
  * I learned to stop prioritizing functionality over design. I remember during one of my first TA 
  meetings, my TA told me to worry more about the design over functionality because it's easier to 
  build functionality from good design than it is to build a good design from a functioning program.

* Personal development steps
  * I want to be better at asking for help. With all the projects, I found myself in a role with 
  a lot of responsibilities, and a teammate who was asking me what needs to be done. I didn't really
  know how distribute work to them, and because of this, our team was less productive. I usually want
  to do things myself since I already envisioned how I want things to be, but I need to let go of that
  habit.
