## Ethics Essay

### Personally helped by computing technology
Google maps and similar services has made it really easy for me
to figure out how to get to new, unknown places. I remember as a child
when my parents had to pull over and unfold the map on the car hood 
to figure out where they were and where they needed to go. Now we just 
type in the address and hit go.

### Personally harmed by computing technology
Google maps has made it so I have little to no knowledge of street names or highway markers. 
All I do is turn and exit when the voice tells me to, so I've never needed to even look at location signs.
Now whenever I drive to someplace that is a little unfamiliar I always need to rely on GPS services 
even if I've been there a couple of times.

### Computing technology trend for society
I think computing technology is an overall net positive for society. Never in history has such a large
portion of the population been able to have access to so much information. Going to school now is less about 
memorization and more about problem-solving because who needs to memorize stuff that can be easily googled.
Computing has also allowed for predictive models to be used to help predict problems allocate resources appropriately.
If we look at the pandemic, that world would've literally stopped if it wasn't for computing technology such as Zoom and
online shopping.

### Computing technology's role in ethics
I learn best by evaluating failures so to learn about ethics in CompSci,
I can read about the failures of tech companies like YouTube and Amazon. I can
also take Humanities courses at Duke that will broaden my understanding of
the human condition.


## Failure Essay

### Personal Experience
I took organic chemistry 1 in my Spring semester of freshman year. My fall semester
was pretty easy and in high school I never learned how to study. This combined with the fact that
orgo didn't assign any homework meant that when exams came around, I literally had no idea what I was doing.
I came pretty close to failing that class (luckily I got to take it pass/fail due to the pandemic) but it was a 
wake up call for me to actually do all the work that the teacher assigns. Since then, I've always read/watched every 
assigned chapter, made sure to understand what I was reading, and wrote down questions on the side if I didn't understand
something. I think overall failing is something that I'm terrified of, but it is the best way that I learn. In AP 
psychology, we learned that people tend to remember the worst and best parts of everything, and failure definitely fits
in the "worst" category. I play a lot of ultimate frisbee, and there will be times when the coach will tell me to 
change something, and until I get beat by opponent, I won't change anything. 

### Positive reframing

* Failure is important

* Failure is a momentary event

* Fail often in order to succeed sooner

* Failing is easy; trying again takes courage

* Failure can be controlled
