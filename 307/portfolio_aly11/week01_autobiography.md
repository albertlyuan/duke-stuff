# CompSci Autobiography
## Albert Yuan


### I AM Statements

1. I am good at working in short burst of focus
2. I am determined to own this class
3. I am an ultimate frisbee player
4. I am working on improving myself as a human
5. I am thankful for the people who've helped 
me during the past week

### Why Study Computer Science
Coming into Duke, I didn't know what I wanted to major in. 
The contenders were Math/CompSci and Chemistry.
My high school didn't have any compsci classes so I started off in chemistry. 
I didn't really like what I was doing in chemistry, as it was a lot of memorization and the worst part was that the 
reactions that we memorized always had hundreds of exceptions. During sophomore year, I decided to check out CompSci 101 
and I really liked it. I enjoyed coding and the process of designing a solution to solve a problem and unlike chemistry, 
I was able to sit down for hours and do compsci homework. This summer, I worked for a startup data science company and 
saw for the first time how the stuff I learned in school could be applied in real world situations. The people I worked 
with were also very smart and seeing the things they could create really motivated me to want to learn more about 
compsci.

### Daily Programming Uses
Besides practice problems on leetcode, I've created in little scripts to do things that are a tad annoying. 
One thing I often use is a script that automatically searches Bing 250 times in order to get Microsoft Rewards, 
which can be used to redeem giftcards. 

### Favorite Programming Project
Over the summer I learned what a data lake is and I helped create the company's semantic lake.
The company is a health care data science company that uses health insurance data and makes models to predict where 
health programs should be targeted. Since there are millions of people in the health insurance network, there are many 
files that come in and out and more that are created as we process and standardize the incoming files. The datalake 
basically records the location other metadata of every file so that it's easy to find everything. What I built helped 
record the location and other metadata of tables that were created by these datalake tables. The coolest part was
just learning about all the different tools such as AWS and sql.

### Programming Event
The best programming experience is definitely seeing all green after submitting APTs. Especially if it was a first try.

### CompSci 307 Motivation
I'm planning on getting the BS Concentration in Software Systems and this class was one of the more appealing of the
option I had.  

### Planning and Designing Code
I'm not one who plans things ever so when I code, I first do a brain dump and create what ever is on my mind. After 
testing, I reevaluate and note things that worked and didn't work.

### Advice for Next Generation
I would've told myself to start coding earlier. I was introduced to it in 8th grade but didn't look into it further. I 
definitely had the capabilities to do it but I just didn't. Also I wish that my younger self took compsci 101 during 
freshman year. Taking it sophomore year has really made it a lot harder to work around schedule conflicts. 

### Societal Role of Computer Science
I think computer science with statistics can be used to solve issues and predict problems before they happen. The 
company I worked at really opened my eyes to the power of data analytics.

### Using Computer Science in the Future
I want to be software engineer. I don't really care if I'm at a startup again or at a Google type company. As long as 
the company is doing something productive and does work that results in a net positive world, I'm game.
