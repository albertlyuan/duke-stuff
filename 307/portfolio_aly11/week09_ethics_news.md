## Issue
I learned about an algorithm that Twitter used to crop previews of images. For example,
if an image was really tall, it was supposed to preview only the section with a face on it. However, 
people proved that it was biased against black people's faces when they uploaded a tall picture with 
the full body of a black man and then just the face of a white man on the bottom. Although to human 
eyes it's obvious that te black man is the 'subject' of the photo, the algorithm previewed the white
man's face. 

## Perspective 1
This problem raises the question about whether AI can be reliably used. AI is rarely regulated,
only recently did New York City require people to disclose whether they use AI to vet potential employees.
Since AI works by feeding in training data, the only way to make an algorithm that doesn't discriminate
is to feed it data with all types of genders, races, and cultures. However, this is much easier said 
than done. We can't just snap a finger and get data of everything because data comes from people 
and usually the people who are in tech aren't all genders, races, and cultures. Since the current state
of our society is like this, it's unethical to use AI since it isn't possible to make it not discriminatory.

## Perspective 2
Although it is difficult to get data that includes all types of people, the fact that we recognize this
problem means we can take steps to account for the bias. Perhaps we sacrifice the speed and accuracy 
of the algorithm for more general results that are inclusive. There is no debate about the power that 
AI has to improve our daily lives and society as a whole. We could have the AI do 90% of the work, 
and then have a simpler program do the rest. The result might not be as accurate, but at least it 
might help eliminate some bias. According to Twitter's own findings, the biases were only by about 5% 
so assuming they're correct, by lowering the sensitivity of the algorithm it should be possible to 
minimize the biases.

## Personal Analysis
I personally think AI is one of the coolest technologies at the moment. Computers can do things 
faster and more efficiently than any human, which was highlighted by the Watson project by IBM.
However, I think Twitter should stop using AI since the impact of automatically cropping pictures
is so inconsequential. For things like employee vetting where people's lives are going to be 
directly impacted by the outcome of AI, I think human verification is a must. Complete AI autonomy
is probably only appropriate for simulations/videogames, and entertainment. However, there are probably
arguments to be made against AI use in those areas, since I too am not very educated in the ethics of
tech.

## Impact
The impact of AI bias is huge. As the world is becoming more technological, AI is gaining popularity 
since it's fast and powerful. However, it's being built by data that isn't representative of all people
and cultures, which is causing biases against traditionally oppressed people. Latin text is being favored
over arabic text. Women's chests and legs are being favored over their faces. White faces are being 
favored over black faces. Although this is just a photo cropping tool, it should raise the issue about
the widespread use of AI since it is being used in much more important application such as facial 
recognition software that's used to vet people.
