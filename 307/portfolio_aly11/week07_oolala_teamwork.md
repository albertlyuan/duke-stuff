### Contributions and Roles

* Describe your role(s) and your satisfaction
  * I lead discussion of design and coded most of Basis (logo) and Darwin. Very Satisfied.
* Describe your team mate(s) role(s) and their satisfaction
  * Scott - did main menu page, css, and command history. Satisfied.
  * Quentin - did rest of logo, and all of Lsystem. Very Satisfied.


### Team Events

* Describe when you felt the most satisfaction
  * I built most of the basis code but just enough for fd to work, while the others completed their
midterms. I took the rest of the week off, while I handled my other classes and when we were about to 
submit, the css and rest of the functions were implemented beautifully. Seeing that was very satifying.

* Describe when you felt the team made the biggest leap ahead
  * After completing basis, I felt like everything went a lot smoother, since the Lsystem and Darwin apps
  were very similar.

* Describe way(s) the team has worked well
  * Since I was alone at first and the other worked the second half of basis, we did a good job
  distributing the work load. Then Quentin and Me each took the other app and completed them while 
  Scott did the main menu and small implementations here and there.

* Describe problem(s) with the way the team worked together
  * We had a lot of merge conflicts due to git unfamiliarity and because we all were modifying the 
  same file. If we split up the work by file/model-view, I think we could've been more efficient


### Learning Opportunities

* Your biggest strength as a team member
  * I think I do my fair share of the work and more, and I contribute ideas to the discussion.

* Your biggest weakness as a team member
  * I am not great at communicating my thoughts clearly

* What you have learned team collaboration/communication during this project
  * I learned that I need to make my git commit messages a lot more descriptive, so when
  people read them, they know where to look when errors happen.

* A specific thing can you do to make team collaboration/communication more productive
  * I think it would be a good idea to try splitting up into frontend-backend coders to minimize
  the amount of merge conflicts and time wasted fixing them.
