## World Domination Plans

* what would you do with that power?
  * There are many things that I would do, but one specifically is to rid of big Pharma. I think one 
  of the stupidest things about America is that medicine like insulin costs $10 dollars to make, but 
  it costs hundreds of dollars to buy. Specifically this would mean enacting some law that prevents 
  drug manufacturers from setting insane prices. Also, in order to promote the development of new drugs,
  I'd allocate more money to scientific and educational grants and probably less to military/defense. 

* why, what are your goals?
  * My goal is to get rid of the insane costs of basic healthcare. It's really lame when something 
  basic like insulin is overpriced, or when very specific treatment for a very specific disease is 
  marked up because the drug manufacturer basically has a monopoly. These high prices cause people 
  who need treatment to avoid treatment because they know that if they survive whatever ailment they
  have, they'll just live a terrible life trying to repay the medical bills.

* what results do you expect or hope for?
  * I hope that medicine costs go down. Insulin should have a double-digit price tag instead of a 
  triple-digit price tag. As a result of this and the cost reduction of other drugs, I also hope that 
  general welfare improves and that diseases become less and less prominent in the world. 

* would you share this power? with whom and why?
  * I would share this power because I'd be afraid that my lack expertise in the field of medicine 
  would lead to inappropriate actions. I think I'd create a panel of the top experts in medicine and 
  use their input to help guide me to a decision. I'd be careful of letting any of them make decision 
  because I've heard that many prominent experts in academia have ties with pharmaceutical companies
  which could lead to biases. Hopefully, with the money that will be allocated to scientific research
  the experts won't have to rely on pharmaceutical companies as heavily since they'll be getting 
  research grants more often.

* would you want it known that you have this power or not? why or why not?
  * I would not want it known so people don't try to persuade me into make a decision in their favor.
  Of course it'd be nice to receive recognition for good work, but at the end of the day, it isn't worth
  potentially getting threatened to make a certain decision. I'm probably dramatizing it too much, but
  what if someone tries to torture me in order to allow a certain drug manufacturer to sell insulin
  at $300.


## World Domination Tech

* how might technology be used to give you this power or to distribute it?
  * Technology can be used to gather information about the drug in question. Is the price tag representative
  of what it's worth? Of course, I'll allow manufacturers to make a living, but it shouldn't be a 
  ridiculous mark up. Also this entire plan is about furthering medicine and the technology needed for
  it, so technology is literally what is healing people.
