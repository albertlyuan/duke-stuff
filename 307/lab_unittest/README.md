====

Buggy implementations to practice creating and running tests:
 * A simple Container class that contains at least 5 distinct bugs
 * Bowling scoring classes that contain at least 1 distinct bug

Add a NEW JUnit test to FIRST verify the bug exists (failing test).
Then fix the bug and verify ALL tests continue to pass.  

The point of this lab is not to stress your debugging skills but to 
practice testing, so how you fix the bugs is entirely up to you but fix 
them ONE at a time, focusing on the process and strategy of making tests.
