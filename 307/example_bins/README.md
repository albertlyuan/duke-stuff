# example_bins

Example code for refactoring to clean, readable, code. During class, it will be refactored and the results pushed back to this repository.

This project reads data from a file representing file sizes and computes multiple ways to fit those files onto fixed size disks. 
The problem described in more detail in [this old assignment](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall04/cos226/assignments/bins.html).  

To run the project:
 * click to expand the folders ```src -> bins``` to find the Java class ```bins.Bins```
 * right click on this class and select ```Run bins.Bins.main()```
