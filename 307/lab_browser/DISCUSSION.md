## Lab Discussion
### Names


### Separating the Model from the View

 * What behaviors should the model have that will be called by the view?

 * What instance variables will be needed to support those behaviors?

 * What values should the model return that can be used appropriately in theÂ view?

 * What values should the model return if you cannot return a proper URL (i.e., it does not exist or the given one wasÂ malformed).

 * How will you test the model?


### Inheritance

 * What common abstraction would help you implement new browser
   features (like favorites, most viewed, etc.)?

 * How would the model manage the concrete implementations?

 * How would the features follow the goal of separating the model from
   the view?
