### Original Code

 * What parts of the solver classes' code is the same?
   * they all mark the next step
   * Majority of instance variables and constructors

 * What parts of the solver classes' code is different?
   * ordering of how paths are marked
   * return values


### Maze Search Algorithm

 * General steps 
   * check win
   * find possible positions
   * choose next position 
   * mark path
   * update position



 * Steps as Java methods
   * isSearchOver()
   * findNextStep()
   * choseNextStep()
   * markPath()
   * updatePosition()


### Refactoring Process

 * Refactoring one subclass's step() method

 * Running the program to make sure it still works correctly

 * Refactoring another subclass's step() method

 * Running the program to make sure it still works correctly

 * Moving methods into the superclass

 * What can be made protected and what can be private?

 * Running the program to make sure it still works correctly
