This lab gets you experience with pointers. Thanks to Mike Hewner for his work on these!

Fork and clone the lab as with previous labs.

There are 10 functions for you to write (the first 8 are graded, the last 2 are optional/for additional practice).  Each function is defined in the file pointers.c and you are
to fill in the function body to implement the specified functionality.  The file pointers.c contains
instructions for each function along with test cases.

Graded functions:
* add_with_pointers
* address_in_array
* bytes_between_4s
* point_to_smallest
* point_to_smallest_ptr
* power_replace
* power_sum_dont_replace
* set_string_with_q

Optional Functions:
* remove_2nd_q_strings
* doublecorrectly

Command line exeuction with no arguments attempts to invoke and test all the functions. (e.g., ./pointers)
You can test an individual function by passing the function name as a command line argument. (e.g., ./pointers add_with_pointers will run only the add_with_pointers test). 

You should verify testing locally by running the following, since this mimics the autograding scripts used by gradescope.

`python3 test_kit.py ALL`

What to submit:
upload your completed pointers.c to gradescope
