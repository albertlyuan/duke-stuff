These tracefiles are modified traces from Lab16 directory to reduce the addresses to be 24 bits, 
info to create is below.

First to create a trace use pintool and then delete the #eof at the end of the trace file.

e.g.,
../../../pin -t obj-intel64/pinatrace.so -- /bin/ls

row_trace.txt and col_trace.txt are traces from smaller versions of the problems in L15.

Then, use reduce_trace.py to create a 24-bit address traces.

pagetable.py is a python version for cross checking
